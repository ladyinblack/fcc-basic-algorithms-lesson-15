## PROBLEM EXPLANATION
Return `true` if the string in the first element of the array containing all of the letters of the string in the second element of the array...

## HINTS 
### Hint 1
- If everything is lowercase, it will be easier to compare.
### Hint 2
- Our strings might be easier to work with if they were arrays of characters.
### Hint 3
A loop might help.  Use `indexOf()` to check if the letter of the second word is on the first.
